# Udacity
“Data Wrangling with Open Street Map and SQL.pdf” is the primary document conveying the Udacity Project. “Create_Sample_File.py” was used to create “sample.osm”–which is a sample of the 1.2GB Austin City data set. Annotations are made in the “data.py” and “audit.py” scripts used for this project. The Austin City data set was created from a custom extract and is too large to include, but the extract referenced in the “Data Wrangling….” contains the link to a similar dataset.
