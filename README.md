# Data Wrangling Project 
“Data Wrangling with Open Street Map and SQL.pdf” is the primary document conveying my findings. “Create_Sample_File.py” was used to create “sample.osm”–which is a sample of the 1.2GB Austin City data set. Annotations are made in the “data.py” and “audit.py” scripts used for this project. The Austin City data set was created from a custom extract and is too large to include, but the extract referenced in the “Data Wrangling….” contains the link to a similar dataset.

Project Overview-
This project is for Udacity Nanodegree and for it I utlized raw XML data from https://www.openstreetmap.org The project focused on data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for Austin, TX. I utlized SQL as the data schema to complete the project.
